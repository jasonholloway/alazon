    /* but in '= 3'
     * the equals does not belong to our node!
     * though the three is the root
     * and the equals is on an intermediate
     * it isn't a node though
     *
     * if we're in an intermediate
     * and we find a subnode in situ
     * then - you'd think we must be in root - but we might not be!
     * 
     * I'm imagining now an intermediate that isn't a root, and yet contains non-root subnodes
     * so we're in a parsing, and our value has its minimal expression in a subnode
     * (which makes us an intermediate)
     * and in this state we find another
     * this would only happen if a node was parsed but thrown away I think - which is possible though odd
     * an intersting edge case        
     *
     * think of eg an empty list as a byproduct of parsing (realistic)
     * this list was jetisoned because of its emptiness
     * do we want it then if it doesn't play a part in the semantic value?
     * not really... an opinionated approach here would be to chuck it
     * if we've not claimed it into the semantic tree, it _must_ be fluff
     * and as fluff, it should float off unowned
     * until it finds its maximum home within a covering node
     * fluff should float, and fluff might be a non-space node
     *
     * that's nicely decided then
     * 
     * so, yes, it is about finding root
     * we have our current value, and we want to find our minimal representation
